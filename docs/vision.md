# Vision — A.R.I. (Asset Relevance Intelligence)

A.R.I. is a personalized financial-intelligence platform that helps investors stay informed about their holdings without wasting time monitoring markets.  

Users connect their portfolios (or manually add tickers) and automatically receive daily and weekly summaries of relevant news and corporate filings.  
Each summary is generated by AI—short, contextual, and tagged with sentiment—so users instantly see which updates are positive, negative, or neutral.  

The goal is to reduce portfolio-monitoring time by, improve information relevance, and provide a foundation for data-driven investing decisions.
